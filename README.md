# Body Area Network on Amazon AWS-IoT
Implementation of Body Area Network on Amazon AWS-IoT cloud9 Instances.

For instructions on how to setup this Body Area Network on your AWS-IoT Cloud9 isntance, refer to [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)

Complete guide on how to setup a similar instance can be found on: [AWS IoT: Developing and Deploying an Internet of Things](
https://www.edx.org/course/aws-iot-developing-and-deploying-an-internet-of-things). This is a edX course where a similar instance using vehicular networks has been setup.

This course teaches you how to build, deploy and analyze secure IoT solutions in the AWS cloud.

The concepts used in the project which can be related to this course are:

* AWS IoT Core
* IoT Device Registry
* AWS IoT Rules
* AWS IoT Device Shadows
* AWS APIs and SDKs with IoT
* IoT communications protocols
* Security

Apart from this a basic understanding on `node.js` and understanding of a body-area-network is required.

This course was used as a basis for the the development of this project, using the ideas and techniques used in this course, and developing on top of what was thought, to modify the code to what was required for my needs in this project.

This project was done as part of the course work for the module CS7NS1 - Scalable Computing at Trinity College Dublin.
